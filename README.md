# FriendFinder
A friend finding app that uses Express and multiple routes! 
A small 10 question survey that the user completes, and after 
the survey gets data from the friends.js, does some magic maths 
and spits out a closest match!

# Gettting Started
Please download node.js and 'npm i' the files in order to run the server file. 
After downloading the packages, run server.js with node, and wait for the PORT.
After the PORT responds, then go to your browser of choice and 
put localhost:3000. Then enjoy the app! 

OR Please go to the HEROKU page that this app is set up to test it 
without downloading it!
